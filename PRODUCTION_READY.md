### ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Steps

#### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your production values:
# - SECRET_KEY (generate a strong random key)
# - Your domain name for SSL
# - Any API keys or external service configurations
```

#### 2. Choose Deployment Method

**Option A: Docker Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Quick start
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Option B: Direct Linux Deployment**
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy.sh production
```

**Option C: Windows Deployment**
```cmd
# Run as administrator
deploy.bat production
```

#### 3. SSL Certificate Setup
- For Docker: Place certificates in `ssl/` directory
- For direct deployment: Use Let's Encrypt with certbot
- Update nginx configuration with your domain

#### 4. Firewall Configuration
- Allow HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic
- Optionally allow SSH (22) for management

### ðŸŽ¯ Post-Deployment Verification

#### Health Checks
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: `curl http://your-domain/health`
- [ ] All routes accessible
- [ ] PWA functionality working (install prompt, offline mode)

#### Performance Tests
- [ ] Dashboard charts render correctly without cutting
- [ ] Forms submit and persist data properly
- [ ] Static files serve with proper caching headers
- [ ] Service worker caches resources correctly

#### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS redirects working
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] No sensitive information in logs
- [ ] Non-root processes running

### ðŸ”§ Management Commands

#### Docker Deployment
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f shop-manager

# Restart application
docker-compose restart shop-manager

# Update application
docker-compose down
git pull
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

# Backup (if using volumes)
docker-compose exec shop-manager tar czf /backup/shop-manager-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /app
```

#### Direct Deployment
```bash
# Service management
sudo systemctl start shop-manager
sudo systemctl stop shop-manager
sudo systemctl restart shop-manager
sudo systemctl status shop-manager

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u shop-manager -f

# Update application
sudo systemctl stop shop-manager
cd /opt/shop-manager
sudo -u shopmanager git pull
sudo -u shopmanager venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo systemctl start shop-manager
```

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Log Files
- Application logs: `logs/app.log`
- Error logs: `logs/error.log`
- Access logs: `logs/access.log` (if configured)
- System logs: `journalctl -u shop-manager`

#### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor disk space usage
- [ ] Rotate log files
- [ ] Update SSL certificates (if using Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Backup application data and configuration
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Check for security updates

#### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor memory usage: `htop` or `docker stats`
- Check response times: Health check monitoring
- Monitor error rates in logs
- Set up alerts for service failures

### ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
1. **Application won't start**
   - Check environment variables in `.env`
   - Verify Python virtual environment
   - Check log files for errors

2. **502 Bad Gateway (Nginx)**
   - Verify application is running on correct port
   - Check Nginx configuration
   - Ensure firewall allows internal traffic

3. **SSL Certificate Issues**
   - Verify certificate files exist and are readable
   - Check certificate expiration dates
   - Ensure domain name matches certificate

4. **PWA Features Not Working**
   - Check service worker registration in browser dev tools
   - Verify manifest.json is accessible
   - Ensure HTTPS is working (PWA requires HTTPS)
